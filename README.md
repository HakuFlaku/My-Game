# Intro
This is a passion project of mine. The idea to the game came from a childhood game of mine "Paper Mario: The Thousand Year Door".
I challenged myself to make this entire project from scratch and to use as little API's as possible, thus progress is slow.
## The tech
This entire game is made in C# and I use Visual Studio for editing/building the project.
There is currently 1 API being used, which is (I need to check the name later) to manage JSON writing and reading from a file.
## How does the game play???
This game since it's inspired by TTYD is turn based combat, with multiple move sets.
With this the game also is to be infinitly generating with enemies with randomized stats, and boss floors every so often.
The game is completely text based currently.
## Future additions
Online multiplayer has been an idea I've had for this game for a long time, however it will most likely start as a LAN multiplayer.
Graphics????
Proper floors. I.e., not just a single room with some enemies.
Items/consumables.
